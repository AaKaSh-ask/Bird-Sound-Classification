# Bird-Sound-Classification
This study uses CNNs to classify bird species from audio recordings converted into spectrograms, achieving high accuracy with effective preprocessing. Future improvements will focus on enhancing model performance using advanced techniques.

Bird sound classification plays a crucial role in ecological monitoring and conservation efforts. This study explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for bird species identification using audio recordings transformed into spectrograms. The dataset, sourced from [Dataset Source], comprises [number] bird species with recordings spanning various durations and habitats. Preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction, normalization, and data augmentation were employed to enhance model robustness. The proposed CNN model consists of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The model was trained on an 80-20 train-validation split with early stopping to prevent overfitting. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis, were used to assess classification performance. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy in classifying bird vocalizations with high accuracy. Future work aims to refine the architecture and incorporate advanced techniques to further improve classification performance.

Bird sound classification is an essential task in bioacoustics, contributing to ecological monitoring, species identification, and conservation efforts. Birds are key indicators of environmental changes, and their vocalizations provide valuable insights into biodiversity and ecosystem health. Traditional manual identification of bird calls is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge, making automated classification methods highly desirable.
With the advancement of machine learning and deep learning, automated bird sound classification has become more feasible and efficient. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in processing audio data when transformed into spectrograms, which convert temporal audio signals into a visual representation of frequency and intensity over time. Spectrogram-based approaches enable CNNs to extract meaningful patterns from bird vocalizations, allowing accurate species classification.
This research aims to develop a CNN-based model for classifying bird species using spectrogram representations of their audio recordings. The dataset, sourced from [Dataset Source], contains recordings of [number] bird species from various habitats. The study applies preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model robustness. The proposed CNN model is trained and evaluated using standard deep learning techniques, and its performance is assessed through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis


METHODOLOGY
Dataset
The dataset for this study comprises bird sound recordings obtained from [Dataset Source, e.g., Xeno-canto or BirdCLEF]. It contains [number] distinct bird species, covering a diverse range of habitats and regions. The audio recordings vary in length from [minimum duration, e.g., 1 second] to [maximum duration, e.g., 10 seconds]. To ensure fair training and evaluation, the dataset is balanced across species

Data Preprocessing
Since raw audio signals vary in format, duration, and quality, preprocessing is necessary to standardize the data before feeding it into the model. The following steps were performed:
1.
Resampling – All audio files were resampled to a standard frequency of 16 kHz to maintain consistency.
2.
Duration Normalization – Audio clips were trimmed or padded to a fixed duration to ensure uniform input length.
3.
Spectrogram Conversion – The audio signals were converted into spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

5.
Data Augmentation – Techniques such as time stretching (speed variations), pitch shifting, and mixup augmentation were applied to enhance model generalization.

Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to classify bird species based on their spectrogram representations. The architecture consists of the following layers:
1.
Convolutional Layers
o
Three convolutional layers with 32, 64, and 128 filters, respectively.
o
Each layer uses a 3×3 kernel followed by ReLU activation.
2.
Pooling Layers
o
Max-pooling layers (pool size = 2×2) are applied to reduce dimensionality while preserving key spectral features.
3.
Dense Layers
o
Two fully connected (dense) layers with 256 and 128 neurons, both activated by ReLU to introduce non-linearity.
4.
Output Layer
o
A softmax layer with [number of bird species] units corresponding to each bird species.
Optimization Strategy:
•
The model is optimized using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
•
Dropout layers (rate = 0.3) are applied between dense layers to prevent overfitting

Evaluation Metrics
To assess model performance, the following metrics were used:
1.
Accuracy – Measures the overall proportion of correctly classified bird sounds.
2.
Precision – Determines the correctness of the model when predicting a specific bird species.
3.
Recall – Evaluates the model’s ability to correctly identify all instances of a bird species.
4.
F1-Score – A harmonic mean of precision and recall, ensuring a balance between both metrics.
5.
Confusion Matrix – Visualizes misclassifications across bird species, highlighting potential errors.
These evaluation metrics provide a comprehensive analysis of the model’s effectiveness in classifying bird species from audio recordings.
